# LinearRegression

Linear regression strives to show the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to observed data. One variable is supposed to be an independent variable, and the other is to be a dependent variable.

For example: the weight of the person is linearly related to his height. Hence this shows a linear relationship between the height and weight of a person

$y = a + bx$
