    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression strives to show the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to observed data. One variable is supposed to be an independent variable, and the other is to be a dependent variable. For example, the weight of the person is linearly related to their height. Hence this shows a linear relationship between the height and weight of a person. As the height increases, the weight of the person also gets increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary that here one variable is dependent on others, or one causes the other, but there is some critical relationship between the two variable. In such cases, we use a scatterplot to imply the strenght of the relationship between the variables. If there is no relation or linking between the variables, the scatterplot does not indicate any increasing or decreasing pattern. For such cases, the LR is not beneficial to the given data.\n",
