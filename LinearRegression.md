# LinearRegression

Linear regression strives to show the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to observed data. One variable is supposed to be an independent variable,
and the other is to be a dependent variable.

For example: the weight of the person is linearly related to his height. Hence this shows a linear relationship between the height and weight of a person As height increases, the
weight of the person also get increased. 

It is not necessary that here once variable is dependent on others, or one causes the other, but there is some critical relationship between the two variables. In such cases, we
use a scatter plot to imply the strength of the relationship between the variables. If there is no relation or linking between the variables, the scatter plot does not indicate 
any increasing or decreasing pattern. For such cases, the LR is not beneficial to the given data.

<b> Linear Regression Equation </b>
l
The measure of the extent of the relationship between two variables is shown by the correlation coefficient. The range of this coefficient lies betweene -1 to 1.

A linear equation is written in the form of :

y = a + bx
